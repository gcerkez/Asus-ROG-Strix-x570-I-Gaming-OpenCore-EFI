# Asus-ROG-Strix-x570-I-Gaming-OpenCore-EFI

This is a working OpenCore based EFI for an Asus ROG Strix x570-I Gaming system.

My specs:
CPU: Ryzen 3700x
Memory: 16GB 3200Mhz
Video Card: 7900XTX (the reason I have stopped using this build, Apple does not support this card)

Additional configuration can be made to suit your needs.

This build presently, loads, installs and restarts correctly into Ventura
